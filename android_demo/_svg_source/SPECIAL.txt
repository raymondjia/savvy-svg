# By default each SVG file will map to a full *set* of PNG files
# For iOS, each set consists of 3 files: the original, @2x, and @3x sizes
# For Android, each set consists of 5 files: ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, and xxhdpi

# However, sometimes you might need to scale an SVG file, or have multiple versions of 
# the same file at different scales. The following example shows:
#
# 1) how to scale an SVG file under the original name
# 2) how to scale an SVG file and save it under a different name
