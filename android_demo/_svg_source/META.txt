# Each SVG file will map to a full *set* of PNG files
# For iOS, each set consists of 3 files: the original, @2x, and @3x sizes
# For Android, each set consists of 5 files: ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, and xxhdpi

# Normally you only need to list the SVG files, with or without the .svg suffix 
# Each will be converted to PNGs under its intrisic dimensions as defined by 
# 'width' and 'height' attributes in the <svg> tag.

# If an SVG needs to be scaled, you can specify a scaling factor. E.g.

account-add-photo           1.5x
account-manage-account      0.75x

# You can add a third argument, which will be used as the base name for the PNG files. E.g.

def-avatar          2.0x       def-avatar-big
def-avatar          3.0x       def-avatar-huge

# If you need the PNG files to have a specific dimension, use the following format. E.g.

def-avatar          30 30
def-avatar          60 60      Icon-60
